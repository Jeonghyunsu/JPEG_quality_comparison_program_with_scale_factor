# JPEG_quality_comparison_program_with_scale_factor

This program is based on the JPEG open source library.

It was created to check how much the image quality changes depending on the value of the parameter that determines the quantization table.

You can not only see the difference in picture quality in the MFC program, but also check the output of the image.

In addition, you can check quantitative evaluation with PSNR.

* Input Image: bmp, jpg
* scale factor of range: <1, 999>
